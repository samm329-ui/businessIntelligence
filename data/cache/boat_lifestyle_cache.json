Despite opening at record highs, the Nifty 50 and Sensex quickly slipped into the red and fell sharply later in the session. India's benchmark stock indices ended their rally by hitting downward trends after a fresh record high for the fourth consecutive session on Friday. Sectors like Metal, Auto, Financial Services, and Energy saw significant declines. Brokerages' Stocks Fall As Microsoft Outage Impacts Operation. On the stock-specific front, Infosys shares rose after posting better-than-expected Q1 FY25 results and raising its FY25 revenue growth forecast to 3-4%. Other top gainers included Asian Paints, LTIMindtree, and Titan Company. In contrast, Persistent Systems fell nearly 7% after its Q1 profit missed estimates.The benchmark index initially opened 52 points higher but quickly faced selling pressure. After reaching a peak of 24854, it dropped over 100 points in the first few minutes of trading, accompanied by high volume, setting the tone for the day. The index continued to trend lower as selling pressure intensified, closing 269 points lower. Despite a significant correction and adverse market and momentum breadth, the index showed resilience by not dropping below the prior day’s low and closing above the psychological mark of 24500. Going forward, it will be crucial for the index to maintain support in the range of 24500-24200 to sustain bullish momentum.-330July 19, 2024· 15:49 IST Riya Singh – Research Analyst, Commodities and Currency , Emkay Global Gold and silver prices experienced a sharp decline following the sentiment that the anticipated bullish phase might have occurred earlier than expected, leading to profit-taking. A recent slowdown in seasonal demand could exert downward pressure on prices if ETF flows do not persist or if tactical investors retreat due to high prices. U.S. data revealed the largest increase in initial jobless claims since early May, indicating a cooling labor market. This development supports a potential rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September. Despite the recent dip, gold remains nearly 20% higher, and silver over 15% higher since the beginning of the year. Additionally, uncertainty in the U.S. political landscape is contributing to short-term volatility. This temporary decline is seen as a necessary adjustment, providing central bankers an opportunity to regain purchase traction. For Gold support is placed at $2385 - $2350 whereas for silver it is at $29. - $28.85On the other hand, oil prices have continued to decline, influenced by weak demand from China and pressure from a stronger dollar. China's economy grew at a much slower pace than expected in the second quarter, countering the narrative of tight supply. However, the significant drawdown in U.S. stockpiles and improved compliance with production cuts by OPEC members are expected to keep the market undersupplied by more than a million barrels, thereby providing support for crude oil prices. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) prices are expected to find support around $78 to $80 per barrel.Meanwhile, the USD/INR is trading at an all-time low due to a stronger dollar and widespread weakness across Asian currencies. According to the latest bulletin released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the central bank purchased $4.2 billion of forex. Additionally, the market is closely monitoring the Union budget for FY 2024-25, to be held on July 23rd, for a clearer picture of economic growth. Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) raised India's growth projection from 6.8% to 7%. The rupee is expected to respect the resistance of 83.75 – 83.85 levels, with a potential retracement to the 83.50 level.AdvertisementRemove Ad-330July 19, 2024· 15:42 IST Parth Nyati, Founder, Tradingo An Anti-virus Crowdstrike faced a technical glitch after an update that affected the Microsoft servers and PCs where this anti-virus was installed.

After adjustments for non-cash and non-operating items such as depreciation (₹399.32 million), finance costs (₹278.85 million), provisions for doubtful advances (₹145.59 million), and reversal of slow-moving inventory provisions (₹589.32 million), the operating profit before working capital changes stood at ₹931.66 million in FY 2025, slightly higher than ₹837.22 million in FY 2024. Working capital adjustments provided a strong boost to cash flows. Notably, there was a reduction in inventories of ₹1,641.26 million, and an increase in trade payables of ₹1,336.57 million, though trade receivables increased by ₹1,056.12 million, creating some outflow. As a result, cash generated from operations rose to ₹4,323.76 million in FY 2025 compared to ₹3,981.32 million in FY 2024. After accounting for taxes, the net cash flow from operating activities was ₹4,415.79 million, higher than the ₹3,934.08 million achieved in FY 2024. This shows significant improvement in operational efficiency and working capital management. Cash Flow from Investing Activities The company’s investing activities showed moderate outflows in FY 2025 compared to FY 2024. The major movements include investment in mutual funds (₹808.13 million), payment of deferred consideration (₹470.85 million), and acquisition of property and intangible assets totaling ₹73.17 million. At the same time, the company redeemed fixed deposits worth ₹5,075 million, while also investing ₹4,995 million, balancing liquidity management. Additional inflows came from dividends from a joint venture (₹30 million) and proceeds from sale of investment in associate (₹127.96 million). Overall, the company reported a net cash outflow of ₹937.71 million in FY 2025, compared to ₹374.18 million in FY 2024. The higher outflow reflects continued strategic investments, but these were partly offset by cash inflows from fixed deposit movements. Cash Flow from Financing Activities Financing activities showed a clear outflow trend. In FY 2025, the company repaid short-term borrowings worth ₹2,959.58 million, alongside lease liability repayments of ₹106.52 million (principal and interest), and borrowing costs of ₹172.56 million. Unlike FY 2024, there was no equity issuance in FY 2025. Consequently, the net outflow from financing activities stood at ₹3,238.66 million in FY 2025, lower than the ₹4,485.67 million outflow in FY 2024, but still a significant drain on cash resources. Net Cash Position Despite heavy outflows from investing and financing activities, strong cash inflows from operations ensured that the company ended FY 2025 on a positive note. The net increase in cash and cash equivalents was ₹233.23 million in FY 2025, reversing the sharp decline of ₹869.58 million in FY 2024. Standalone Fin",

It is known for combining exceptional audio quality, cutting-edge design, and flawless craftsmanship. Aman Gupta, co-founder of boAt and guy widely regarded as the most entertaining or cinematic shark, discussed the naming process for the company during an appearance on the Kapil Sharma Show. Even with so many \"music-friendly\" alternatives, their goal was to make an impact on clients that would remain. Since the 'A' for Apple had already been chosen, they decided to go with the first word that sprang to mind beginning with the second letter, 'B'. Consequently, boAt was established and currently holds a 48% market share. Revenue & Business Model At boAt, Sameer Mehta and Aman Gupta are co-founders. Now that Boat has two channels of revenue, it may be accessed online and off. They have already discussed their online partners, who use the distribution strategy to service their offline clientele. Boat's goods are distributed to physical shops via more than 20 distributors. BoAt expands its market share by selling audio items on a variety of e-commerce sites, including Amazon and Flipkart, and concurrently entering physical retail spaces through joint ventures with multi-brand and consumer electronics shops. By including warranty services in its after-sales products, boAt increases customer satisfaction and encourages recurring business. The brand also makes use of its fame by teaming up with influencers and businesses to produce co-branded goods, which promote joint sales and exclusive releases through brand collaborations and licensing. With its agile business approach, boAt prioritizes knowing its customers' requirements, wants, and behaviour patterns. It has a considerable competitive advantage due to its quick adaptation and responsiveness in providing clients with exactly what they desire.

The company is also aggressively growing its offline presence. This omnichannel approach guarantees accessibility for clients with a range of purchasing preferences while also promoting overall brand growth and market reach. Segments of Boat BoAt's significant revenue of â‚¹947.35 crores in the Earphones & Headphones domain is indicative of its robust market presence and appealing consumer base. At â‚¹297.40 crores, wireless speakers also make up a sizeable portion of boAt's income stream, demonstrating the brand's success in offering high-quality audio options outside of personal listening devices. Another important product category wired earphones, brings in â‚¹94.92 crores in sales, demonstrating boAt's wide range of products that suit different consumer tastes. Furthermore, boAt's Other Accessories & Products sales, which include Chargers & More, amount to â‚¹172.03 crores, indicating the brand's capacity to use supplementary product categories to amplify its financial success. Industry Research The wireless speaker market in India is expected to develop significantly; it is expected to reach USD 859.99 million by 2029 from its estimated USD 328.84 million size in 2024. This growth trajectory indicates a noteworthy Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 21.20% for the 2024–2029 projected period. The market is expanding due to a number of factors, such as increased smartphone penetration, more people having access to the internet at lower costs, growing need for audio solutions that are portable and flexible, and faster adoption rates of new technologies across the nation. The reason for the rise in smart speaker use in India is their capacity to deliver audio material wirelessly with ease, improving the overall sound quality on both connected and non-wired platforms. Furthermore, the incorporation of voice assistants such as Google and Amazon has a substantial impact on altering consumer preferences regarding music consumption, thereby driving market expansion. In addition, the Indian industry is seeing a surge in demand for portable and interoperable products like wireless speakers due to the quick expansion of digital streaming services. Given the existence of both domestic players like JioSaavn, Gaana, and Wynk as well as international behemoths like Spotify, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and the most recent addition, YouTube Music, this development is especially notable. Furthermore, the USD 19.5 million that Krafton invested in the Indian audio content platform Kuku FM in March 2022 highlights the growing prospects and investments in the country's audio streaming market. The Indian headphones market is expected to generate $0.8 billion in sales in 2024, growing at a predicted annual rate of 3.10% (CAGR 2024-2028). China leads the world in comparison, with the largest revenue expected to reach INR 4,063.0 million in 2024. Considering the future, it is projected that the headphone market would reach 128.9 million units by 2028, growing at a rate of 4.6% by 2025. In 2024, the average volume per person is anticipated to be 0.1 units. The increasing demand for wireless and noise-canceling features is driving the robust expansion of the Indian headphone market, showing a growing customer desire for innovative audio solutions.
