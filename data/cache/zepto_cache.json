IANS Published On Dec 27, 2025 at 10:18 AM IST Read by 100 Professionals Copy Link Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin Share on X Share on Telegram Share on Facebook Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, cofounders, Zepto Mumbai: Quick commerce company Zepto saw its losses widen significantly in the financial year 2024-25 (FY25) even as its sales more than doubled.According to the company's audited financial statements, Zepto reported total sales of Rs 9,668.8 crore in FY25, a sharp jump of 129 per cent from Rs 4,223.9 crore in FY24.However, its net loss expanded much faster, rising 177 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 3,367.3 crore, compared with a loss of Rs 1,214.7 crore in the previous year.The widening losses reflect the intense spending required to expand operations, add dark stores and attract customers in a market where competition has heated up considerably. Advt In FY25, Zepto's losses amounted to around 35 per cent of its turnover, up from about 29 per cent in FY24.In the quick commerce business, companies typically recognise only about 15-20 per cent of gross merchandise value as revenue.Based on this, Zepto's operational revenue for FY25 is estimated to be between Rs 1,495 crore and Rs 1,994 crore, even though it reported close to Rs 10,000 crore in total sales including other income.Competitive pressure has intensified further after FY25 and continued into the first and second quarters of FY26.Major players have continued aggressive expansion by adding more dark stores, increasing delivery capacity and offering high customer incentives.The competition escalated further after Zepto raised $450 million, prompting rivals to speed up their own expansion plans to protect market share.Analysts tracking the sector have said this phase has kept margins under heavy pressure despite rapid growth in demand.The FY25 performance also comes at a time when Zepto is preparing to enter the public markets. The company is set to confidentially file its draft IPO papers on December 26.Alongside this, Zepto has made changes at the board level. Founders Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, along with chief financial officer Ramesh Bafna, have been appointed as whole-time directors after shareholder approval at an extraordinary general meeting held on December 23.

The operating cash flow was significantly impacted by various working capital adjustments. There was an increase in trade receivables (₹2,528.68 million) and other current assets (₹563.28 million), both of which reduced cash flow. However, inventory decreased by ₹311.86 million, providing some positive inflow. Other favorable adjustments included a rise in trade payables (₹2,200.15 million) and depreciation & amortisation (₹1,209.80 million), indicating continued investment in tangible and intangible assets. Non-cash adjustments such as share-based payments (₹737.55 million) and fair value losses (₹79.82 million) also contributed positively to the reconciled profit. After considering these adjustments, net cash used in operations stood at ₹11,136.63 million. Following income tax payments of ₹4.87 million and other outflows of ₹183.03 million, the net cash outflow from operating activities totaled ₹11,314.79 million, indicating a substantial drain on cash from core business operations. Cash Flow from Investing Activities In FY 2023–24, Kiranakart’s investing activities reflected a net inflow of ₹3,230.61 million, a sharp turnaround from the outflow of ₹7,262.32 million in FY 2022–23. The company realized significant proceeds from the sale of investment property (₹32,385.15 million), which largely offset new purchases of investment property (₹31,510.79 million). Additional sources of inflow included interest received (₹278.75 million) and other investing inflows (₹3,100.39 million). These inflows outweighed outflows such as the purchase of property, plant, and equipment (₹1,024.87 million). Overall, the company managed to generate positive cash from its investment activities during the year, largely driven by asset sales and financial gains. Cash Flow from Financing Activities Financing activities provided a net inflow of ₹11,889.69 million in FY 2023–24, compared to ₹16,430.59 million in the prior year. The major source of financing cash was the issuance of other equity instruments (₹12,494.99 million), suggesting the company raised fresh funds from investors. It also generated ₹427.04 million from issuing debentures and bonds. However, there were outflows due to lease payments (₹853.89 million) and interest expenses (₹178.45 million). Despite being lower than last year’s financing inflows, this segment remains the primary contributor to cash generation, helping offset the large operational deficit. Net Change in Cash and Cash Equivalents Overall, Kiranakart Technologies experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of ₹3,805.51 million in FY 2023–24, compared to a decrease of ₹1,654.75 million in FY 2022–23. This improvement was primarily due to strong financing inflows and positive investing results, despite the significant operational cash outflows. Consequently, the company’s cash balance at year-end stood at ₹3,982.85 million, up from ₹177.34 million in the previous year — a sign of improved liquidity management and access to financing during the period.

Revenue and Profit Trends Zepto has seen rapid growth over the past three years, with revenue climbing from ₹50 Cr in FY21 to a projected ₹700 Cr in FY23. Despite impressive top-line momentum, the company continues to report substantial losses, indicating aggressive customer acquisition and operational expansion strategies. Net losses deepened to ₹250 Cr in FY23. The widening gap between revenue and profit suggests high burn rates, likely tied to logistics, warehousing, and workforce expansion. While profitability remains elusive, the rising revenue base reflects strong demand and a scalable delivery model. Zepto may focus on unit economics next to narrow its losses. Expense Efficiency & Margins Zepto’s EBITDA margin has consistently remained negative, ranging from -25% to -35% over the last three fiscal years. Its expense-to-revenue ratio has hovered around 1.3–1.4x, indicating high operational costs relative to income. These numbers underline the capital-intensive nature of quick commerce businesses. The slight fluctuations suggest early efforts toward efficiency, but the cost of last-mile delivery, warehousing, and marketing remain substantial contributors to the margin gap. Achieving breakeven may depend on increasing average order values and optimizing delivery logistics. Reducing CAC (customer acquisition cost) and improving fulfillment density are likely on Zepto’s roadmap for margin improvement. Employee Trend & Insights Zepto’s team has expanded from around 500 employees in FY21 to nearly 1,300 in FY23. This sharp rise in headcount aligns with its national expansion strategy and the build-out of its dark store infrastructure. A growing workforce supports its 10-minute delivery promise, especially in Tier-1 cities. However, such rapid scale also brings challenges in operational efficiency, training, and retention. The company likely includes gig-based delivery partners in this count. Human resource investments appear necessary for fulfillment quality, though balancing automation and manpower will be key to long-term scalability. The hiring pace may moderate once key metro hubs are stabilized. Strategic Growth, Plans & IPO Continues expanding its dark store footprint across India. Focus on Tier-1 cities with plans for Tier-2/3 penetration. Investing in tech and data science for logistics optimization. IPO discussions reportedly underway for 2025 or later. Exploring private labels and high-frequency SKUs to boost margins. Latest News In May 2024, Zepto raised $200 million in a pre-IPO round led by StepStone Group, boosting its valuation to over $1.4 billion. The company also announced aggressive hiring and warehouse expansion across Delhi and Mumbai. Additionally, Zepto launched a premium grocery line focused on organic produce, aligning with changing urban consumption trends. This move strengthens its offering against major competitors like Blinkit and Instamart. Reports suggest Zepto may file DRHP in late 2024 for a 2025 IPO. The startup is also testing express pharmacy delivery in select zones, hinting at vertical expansion opportunities beyond groceries. Overall Summary Metric Detail Employees 1300 ↑ — Indicates scaling & ops growth Revenue ₹700 Cr ↑ — Strong YoY growth PAT -₹250 Cr ↓ — Still in loss-making phase EBITDA Margin -35% ↓ — Cost-heavy model Strategic Investments Increased — Dark stores, tech, hiring IPO Status Expected 2025 — In prep stage Expansion Focus Metro + Tier-2/3 — Infra & geography Latest News $200M round — Pre-IPO boost Conclusion Zepto has emerged as a formidable player in the quick commerce space, with rapid revenue growth and strong investor backing. Though profitability remains a challenge, its aggressive infrastructure build-up and tech-led delivery model provide a strong foundation for scaling. With an IPO potentially on the horizon, Zepto's next milestones will likely focus on efficiency, customer retention, and margin improvement.

Zepto’s FY25 performance comes on the back of aggressive execution and disciplined expansion. According to earlier Aadit Palicha’s post, the company was at $3 billion in annualized gross order value (GOV) and halved its losses over the last year. In FY24, Zepto incurred losses of Rs 1,248 crore on revenue of Rs 4,454 crore. That means the startup spent Rs 1.29 to earn every Rs 1 of revenue in FY24, a figure it has reportedly improved in FY25 with better unit economics, higher fill rates, and stronger contribution margins. We are not comparing Zepto's FY25 numbers with Instamart and Blinkit due to differences in their business models and accounting practices. However, the NOV (net order value) of Blinkit stood at Rs 22,731 crore in FY25, while Swiggy’s quick commerce biz Instamart GOV was recorded at Rs 14,600 crore in the same period. Zepto's founder Aadit Palicha did not comment on the story. As per a recent report, Zepto is in talks to raise $500 million at a potential $7 billion valuation, a significant jump from its previous valuation of $5 billion when it raised $350 million in November 2024. The fresh round is expected to bolster Zepto’s runway ahead of a potential IPO in 2026, as the company pushes toward EBITDA break-even in the next 12–15 months.View Source2Related NewsZepto raises fresh funds from Elcid Investment at $2.26 Bn valuationEntrackr · 6m ago Medial Zepto raises fresh funds from Elcid Investment at $2.26 Bn valuation Quick commerce platform Zepto raised Rs 7.5 crore from Elcid Investment at a valuation of Rs 19,231 crore ($2.26 billion), according to its stock exchange filing.

As per the filing, Elcid Investment is set to acquire 22,55,639 equity shares of Zepto at a price of Rs 33.23 per share, translating to a 0.039% equity stake in the company.
