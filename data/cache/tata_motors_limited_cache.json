The company produces trucks, vans, and buses.[4] The company was incorporated in 2024 as TML Commercial Vehicles, after Tata Motors announced the demerger of its commercial vehicles business. In October 2025, the demerger came into effect and the demerged entity TML Commercial Vehicles was subsequently renamed Tata Motors, while the original Tata Motors was renamed Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles.[5][6] The company's notable subsidiaries include Tata Daewoo, Tata Marcopolo, and the proposed acquisition of Iveco. Tata Motors has joint ventures with Hitachi (Tata Hitachi Construction Machinery) and Stellantis, which makes engines and vehicle components for Fiat Chrysler and Tata-branded vehicles. Tata Motors is listed on the BSE and NSE, and is a constituent of the BSE SENSEX and NIFTY 50 benchmark indices.[7] History[edit] See also: Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles § History Background[edit] Tata Group entered the commercial vehicle sector in 1954 after forming a joint venture with Mercedes-Benz of Germany in which Tata developed a manufacturing facility in Jamshedpur for Daimler lorries.[8] By November 1954 Tata and Daimler manufactured their first goods carrier chassis at the Jamshedpur plant with 90-100 hp and capacity of 3-5 tons.[9] Following the liberalization of economy in India in 1991, Mercedes-Benz partnered with TELCO to officially enter the Indian market to produce and launch the W124 Mercedes-Benz E-Class, marking entry of luxury brand segment in India.[10] However, the car was not a success due to public perception, as Mercedes Benz had transitioned to the W210 E-Class globally, but over the years, the W124 has been positively received for reliability and simplicity.[11] Mercedes Benz eventually launched the W210 E-class in 1998 and produced the car in partnership with TELCO with CKD kits. In the 2000s, Tata Motors made a series of acquisitions and partnerships, including the acquisition of Daewoo's South Korea-based truck manufacturing unit,[12] a joint venture with the Brazil-based Marcopolo, Tata Marcopolo Bus,[13] and the acquisition of Hispano Carrocera.[14] Demerger[edit] In March 2024, the original Tata Motors announced that it would split into two separate listed entities through a demerger. Consequently, the commercial vehicles business was transferred to its wholly owned subsidiary called TML Commercial Vehicles Limited, which was incorporated on 23 June 2024. The India passenger vehicles business, Jaguar Land Rover, and the majority stake in Tata Technologies remained under Tata Motors.[15][16][17] The demerger went into effect on 1 October 2025.[18] After the demerger, TML Commercial Vehicles was renamed Tata Motors, while the original Tata Motors was renamed Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles.[19] Operations[edit] Tata Motors has commercial vehicle manufacturing plants at Jamshedpur (Jharkhand), Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh), Pantnagar (Uttarakhand), and Dharwad (Karnataka). Tata Daewoo[edit] Main article: Tata Daewoo Tata LPT Trucks made at overseas plantsTata Daewoo (officially Tata Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Company and formerly Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Company) is a commercial vehicle manufacturer headquartered in Gunsan, Jeollabuk-do South Korea, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Motors. It is the second-largest heavy commercial vehicle manufacturer in South Korea and was acquired by Tata Motors in 2004. The principal reasons behind the acquisition were to reduce Tata's dependence on the Indian commercial vehicle market (which was responsible for around 94% of its sales in the MHCV segment and around 84% in the light commercial vehicle segment) and expand its product portfolio by leveraging on Daewoo's strengths in the heavy-tonnage sector. Tata Motors has jointly worked with Tata Daewoo to develop trucks such as Novus and World Truck and buses including GloBus and StarBus. In 2012, Tata began developing a new line to manufacture competitive and fuel-efficient commercial vehicles to face the competition posed by the entry of international brands such as Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, and Navistar into the Indian market.[20] Tata Marcopolo[edit] Main article: Tata Marcopolo A Tata Marcopolo bus in use in Chandigarh, India Tata Marcopolo is a bus-manufacturing company which was established as a joint venture between Tata Motors (51%) and the Brazil-based Marcopolo S.A. (49%). The company manufactures and assembles fully built buses and coaches targeted at developing mass rapid transportation systems. It uses technology and expertise in chassis and aggregates from Tata Motors, and know-how in processes and systems for bodybuilding and bus body design from Marcopolo. Tata Marcopolo's low-floor city bus is widely used by transport corporations in many Indian cities. Its manufacturing facility is based in Dharwad, Karnataka, India and Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. In December 2020, Marcopolo and Tata Motors came to an agreement, whereby Tata Motors would purchase the 49 percent stake held by Marcopolo in the bus-making joint venture for ₹100 crore, bringing curtains to the 14-year old partnership and paving the way for a smooth exit for the Brazilian company. The deal was completed on 29 August 2022.[21] The deal allowed Tata Motors to continue using the ‘Marcopolo’ trademark for a minimum of three years with a non-compete provision in India for a corresponding period. Former subsidiaries[edit] Tata Hispano[edit] Main article: Tata Hispano Tata Hispano Motors Carrocera, S.A. was a bus and coach manufacturer based in Zaragoza, Aragon, Spain, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Motors. Tata Hispano has plants in Zaragoza, Spain, and Casablanca, Morocco. Tata Motors first acquired a 21% stake in Hispano Carrocera SA in 2005,[22] and purchased the remaining 79% for an undisclosed sum in 2009, making it a fully owned subsidiary, subsequently renamed Tata Hispano. In 2013, Tata Hispano ceased production at its Zaragoza plant.[23][24] TML Drivelines[edit] TML Drivelines Ltd. was a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Motors engaged in the manufacture of gearboxes and axles for heavy and medium commercial vehicles. It has production facilities at Jamshedpur and Lucknow. TML Drivelines was formed through the merger of HV Transmission and HV Axles. TML Drivelines was merged with Tata Motors in 2017.[25] Products[edit] The company's commercial vehicles include: Tata Ace Tata Ace Zip Tata Ace EV Tata Super Ace Tata Ace Mega Tata Intra Tata Intra V10 Tata Intra V20 Tata Intra V30 Tata Intra V50 Tata Xenon XT Tata Yodha Tata Iris Tata Yodha/Xenon Pick-up truck Tata 407 Ex and Ex2 Tata 709 Ex Tata 807 (Steel cabin chassis, cowl chassis, medium bus chassis, steel cabin + steel body chassis) Tata 809 Ex and Ex2 Tata 909 Ex and Ex2 Tata 1210 SE and SFC (Semi Forward) Tata 1210 LP (Long Plate) Tata 1109 (Intermediate truck/ LCV bus) Tata 1512c (Medium bus chassis) Tata 1515c/1615 (Medium bus chassis) Tata 1612c/1616c/1618c (Heavy bus chassis) Tata 1618 (Semilow-floor bus chassis) Tata 1623 (Rear-engined low-floor bus chassis) Tata 1518C (Medium truck) 10 ton Tata 1613/1615c (Medium truck) Tata 1616/1618c (Heavy duty truck) Tata 2515c/2516c/2518c (Heavy duty 10-wheeler truck) Tata Starbus (Branded buses for city, intercity, school bus, and standard passenger transportation) Tata Divo (Hispano Divo) Tata CityRide (12- to 20-seater buses for intracity use) Tata 3015 (Heavy truck) Tata 3118 (Heavy truck) (8×2) Tata 3516 (Heavy truck) Tata 4018 (Heavy truck) Tata 4923 (Ultraheavy truck) (6×4) Tata Novus Tata Prima Tata SIGNA series Tata Ultra series (ICV Segment) Tata Winger - (Maxivan) In September 2010, Tata Motors presented four CNG–Electric Hybrid low-floored Starbuses to the Delhi Transport Corporation, to be used during the 2010 Commonwealth Games. These were the first environmentally friendly buses to be used for public transportation in India.[citation needed] Notable vehicles[edit] Tata 407[edit] Main article: Tata 407 A Tata 407 being used as water truck The Tata 407 is a light commercial vehicle (LCV) that has sold over 500,000 units since its launch in 1986.[26] In India, this vehicle dominates market share of the LCV category, accounting for close to 75% of LCV sales.
