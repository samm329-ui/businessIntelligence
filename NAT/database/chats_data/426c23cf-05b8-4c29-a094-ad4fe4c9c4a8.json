      "content": "## Comparison of TCS, Infosys, and Wipro\n\nThe three Indian IT giants - TCS, Infosys, and Wipro - have recently announced their quarterly results. Here's a comparison of their performance based on revenue, EBITDA, margins, PE ratio, and growth.\n\n### Revenue (in INR crores)\n\n* TCS: \u20b959,692 crores (Q3 FY26) [1]\n* Infosys: \u20b938,318 crores (Q3 FY26) [1]\n* Wipro: \u20b922,510 crores (Q3 FY26) [1]\n\n### EBITDA (in INR crores)\n\n* TCS: \u20b913,385 crores (Q3 FY26) [2]\n* Infosys: \u20b98,351 crores (Q3 FY26) [2]\n* Wipro: \u20b94,434 crores (Q3 FY26) [2]\n\n### EBITDA Margins\n\n* TCS: 22.4% (Q3 FY26) [2]\n* Infosys: 21.8% (Q3 FY26) [2]\n* Wipro: 19.7% (Q3 FY26) [2]\n\n### PE Ratio\n\n* TCS: 24.41 (as of February 2026) [3]\n* Infosys: 23.19 (as of February 2026) [3]\n* Wipro: 21.41 (as of February 2026) [3]\n\n### Growth (YoY)\n\n* TCS: 5.4% (Q3 FY26 vs Q3 FY25) [1]\n* Infosys: 7.3% (Q3 FY26 vs Q3 FY25) [1]\n* Wipro: 4.8% (Q3 FY26 vs Q3 FY25) [1]\n\n## Which is better for investment?\n\nWhile all three companies have shown stable growth, Infosys seems to have an edge in terms of revenue growth and EBITDA margins. However, TCS has a higher EBITDA margin and a more stable PE ratio.\n\nIt's essential to note that the Indian IT sector is expected to grow steadily in the coming years, driven by digital transformation and cloud adoption. Therefore, all three companies have the potential to deliver long-term growth.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nBased on the current performance, Infosys might be a better bet for investors looking for growth, while TCS could be a more stable option for those seeking steady returns. Wipro, however, might be a good value pick for investors looking for a relatively lower PE ratio.\n\n## Sources\n\n[1] [TCS vs Infosys vs Wipro vs HCL Technologies: Which IT stock to buy after Q3 results 2026](https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/tcs-vs-infosys-vs-wipro-vs-hcl-technologies-which-it-stock-to-buy-after-q3-results-2026-11768701462777.html)\n[2] [Earnings Comparison of IT Stocks: TCS, Infosys, Wipro and HCL](https://www.angelone.in/news/share-market/earnings-comparison-of-it-stocks-analysing-tcs-infosys-wipro-and-hcl-techs-performance)\n[3] [TCS Vs Infosys Vs HCL Tech Vs Wipro: Which IT Stock Should You Buy After Q1 Results](https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/tcs-vs-infosys-vs-hcl-tech-vs-wipro-which-it-stock-should-you-buy-after-q1-results-8941360)\n\nPlease consult a financial advisor or conduct your own research before making any investment decisions.",
